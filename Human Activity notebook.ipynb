    "# HumanActivity Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How data was recorded\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the sensors(Gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone, they have captured '3-axial linear acceleration'(_tAcc-XYZ_) from accelerometer and '3-axial angular velocity' (_tGyro-XYZ_) from Gyroscope with several variations. \n",
    "\n",
    "> prefix 't' in those metrics denotes time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> suffix 'XYZ' represents 3-axial signals in X , Y, and Z directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature names\n",
    "\n",
    "1. These sensor signals are preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width windows(sliding windows) of 2.56 seconds each with 50% overlap. ie., each window has 128 readings. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. From Each window, a feature vector was obtianed by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.\n",
    "> In our dataset, each datapoint represents a window with different readings \n",
    "3. The accelertion signal was saperated into Body and Gravity acceleration signals(___tBodyAcc-XYZ___ and ___tGravityAcc-XYZ___) using some low pass filter with corner frequecy of 0.3Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After that, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtian _jerk signals_ (___tBodyAccJerk-XYZ___ and ___tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ___). \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidian norm. This magnitudes are represented as features with names like _tBodyAccMag_, _tGravityAccMag_, _tBodyAccJerkMag_, _tBodyGyroMag_ and _tBodyGyroJerkMag_.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, We've got frequency domain signals from some of the available signals by applying a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). These signals obtained were labeled with ___prefix 'f'___ just like original signals with ___prefix 't'___. These signals are labeled as ___fBodyAcc-XYZ___, ___fBodyGyroMag___ etc.,.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. These are the signals that we got so far.\n",

    "8. We can esitmate some set of variables from the above signals. ie., We will estimate the following properties on each and every signal that we recoreded so far.\n",

    "\t+ ___entropy()___: Signal entropy\n",
    "\t+ ___arCoeff()___: Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4\n",
    "\t+ ___correlation()___: correlation coefficient between two signals\n",
    "\t+ ___maxInds()___: index of the frequency component with largest magnitude\n",
    "\t+ ___meanFreq()___: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency\n",
    "\t+ ___skewness()___: skewness of the frequency domain signal \n",
    "\t+ ___kurtosis()___: kurtosis of the frequency domain signal \n",
    "\t+ ___bandsEnergy()___: Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.\n",
    "\t+ ___angle()___: Angle between to vectors.\n",
    "\n",
